# Quick Start Guide - Morning Edition ☀️

## 🎯 What Happened Last Night

While you slept, I created a comprehensive TDD test suite (25 tests) for the booking modal and set up the infrastructure for completing the Alpine.js migration.

## ⚡ Quick Actions

### 1. Run New Tests (2 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- booking-modal.spec.js
```
**Expected**: All 25 tests should pass ✅

### 2. Deploy to Production (5 minutes)
```bash
# In PythonAnywhere Bash console:
cd ~/tcz && bash deploy_update.sh
```
Then tell me: **"reload the webapp"**

### 3. Test Production
Visit: https://woifh.pythonanywhere.com
- Test booking modal
- Create a booking
- Cancel a booking
